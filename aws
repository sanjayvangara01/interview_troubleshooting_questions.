Perfect. Now we move to AWS Cloud real-time troubleshooting 🔥
I’ll give you high-frequency production scenarios that are commonly asked in DevOps / SRE interviews.

I’ll answer each using your structured format:

Step 1 – Understand impact
Step 2 – Inspect
Step 3 – Possible causes
Step 4 – Fix
Step 5 – Monitor & Prevent

These are aligned with AWS DevOps / SRE roles like Paytm, Grid Dynamics, Equifax, etc.

🔥 1️⃣ EC2 Instance Not Reachable
Step 1 – Understand Impact

Is it single instance or entire ASG?

Is it production?

Is health check failing on ALB?

Step 2 – Inspect

Check:

Instance status checks

Security groups

NACLs

Route table

Commands / Console:

EC2 → Instance Status

Check System Status & Instance Status

Check public/private IP

Step 3 – Possible Causes

Security group blocking port

NACL blocking traffic

Instance failed system check

SSH key issue

Route table misconfiguration

Instance stopped

Disk full

Step 4 – Fix

Open required port in SG (e.g., 22, 80, 443)

Verify inbound/outbound rules

Restart instance

Detach and attach volume if corrupted

Fix route table for internet gateway

Step 5 – Prevent

Enable CloudWatch alarms

Use ASG for auto recovery

Use Bastion host properly

Enable EC2 auto recovery feature

🔥 2️⃣ Application Behind ALB Returning 502/503
Step 1 – Confirm

Check:

Is ALB healthy?

Are targets healthy?

Step 2 – Inspect
Check Target Group → Health Status

Check:

Target health

Port mismatch

Health check path

Step 3 – Causes

Wrong health check endpoint

App crashed

Security group blocking ALB

Port mismatch

Instance overloaded

Step 4 – Fix

Correct health check path

Verify app listening port

Increase instance capacity

Fix security group rule

Step 5 – Prevent

Proper health checks

Autoscaling enabled

Monitoring on 5xx errors

🔥 3️⃣ RDS Database Not Connecting
Step 1 – Understand

Is DB instance available?

Is it public or private?

Step 2 – Inspect

Check:

RDS status

Security group

DB endpoint

Subnet group

Step 3 – Causes

Security group not allowing inbound

Wrong credentials

RDS in wrong subnet

DB overloaded

Max connections reached

Step 4 – Fix

Update SG to allow app server

Reset credentials

Scale instance

Increase max connections

Step 5 – Prevent

Enable CloudWatch metrics

Use connection pooling

Monitor CPU & connections

🔥 4️⃣ High AWS Bill Suddenly
Step 1 – Identify Source

Go to:

AWS Cost Explorer

Step 2 – Analyze

Check:

EC2 usage spike?

EBS snapshot growth?

Data transfer increase?

NAT Gateway cost?

Unused EIPs?

Step 3 – Causes

Orphan EBS volumes

Unused load balancer

Large instance type

High outbound traffic

No autoscaling

Step 4 – Fix

Delete unused volumes

Rightsize instances

Use Savings Plans

Use S3 lifecycle rules

Step 5 – Prevent

Set billing alarm

Tag resources properly

Weekly cost review

🔥 5️⃣ IAM Permission Denied Error
Step 1 – Identify

Error:

AccessDenied
Step 2 – Inspect

Check IAM role

Check attached policies

Check trust relationship

Step 3 – Causes

Missing permission

Wrong policy attached

STS assume role failure

Step 4 – Fix

Attach correct policy

Update inline policy

Validate trust relationship

Step 5 – Prevent

Use least privilege

Use IAM Access Analyzer

Maintain role documentation

🔥 6️⃣ EKS Cluster Nodes Not Joining
Step 1 – Check Node Group
kubectl get nodes
Step 2 – Inspect

Check EC2 instance IAM role

Check security group

Check bootstrap script

Check kubelet logs

Step 3 – Causes

IAM role missing worker node policy

SG blocking API server

Wrong cluster name in bootstrap

CNI plugin issue

Step 4 – Fix

Attach AmazonEKSWorkerNodePolicy

Fix SG rules

Validate userdata script

Step 5 – Prevent

Use managed node groups

Monitor node status

🔥 7️⃣ S3 Access Denied
Step 1 – Identify

Is bucket private?
Is IAM user allowed?

Step 2 – Inspect

Bucket policy

IAM role

Public access block

Step 3 – Causes

Explicit deny in bucket policy

Missing s3:GetObject

Wrong region

Step 4 – Fix

Update bucket policy

Update IAM policy

Step 5 – Prevent

Use least privilege

Enable S3 access logging

🔥 8️⃣ Lambda Function Failing
Step 1 – Inspect

Check:

CloudWatch logs

Lambda timeout

Memory config

Step 2 – Causes

Timeout too low

Memory too small

VPC misconfiguration

IAM role issue

Step 3 – Fix

Increase timeout

Increase memory

Check VPC config

Update IAM role

Step 4 – Prevent

Add CloudWatch alarm

Add retry logic

Monitor duration
