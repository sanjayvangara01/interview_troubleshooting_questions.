Priority 1 – Kubernetes (VERY HIGH – 100% WILL BE ASKED)

This will be their main focus.

They will test:

Must know deeply:

Pod lifecycle

Deployment, Service, Ingress

CrashLoopBackOff debugging

ImagePullBackOff debugging

Resource requests & limits

HPA

RBAC

ConfigMaps & Secrets

Probes (liveness/readiness)

Real scenarios they may ask:

Pod crashing randomly

Traffic not reaching app

Deployment rollback

Service not reachable

Reason:
Their JD explicitly mentions reliability, scalability, infra.

🥈 Priority 2 – AWS Cloud (VERY HIGH – 95%)

They will test your cloud understanding.

Most important services:

MUST know:

IAM (roles, policies)

EC2

EKS

ECR

VPC basics

Security Groups

Load Balancer

CloudWatch

Scenarios:

EKS cannot pull image from ECR

EC2 not accessible

Application slow in AWS

IAM permission denied

🥉 Priority 3 – CI/CD (Jenkins / GitHub Actions) (VERY HIGH – 90%)

This is core DevOps responsibility.

They will ask:

Explain your pipeline

Pipeline failure debugging

Secret management

Deployment strategy

Rollback strategy

Scenario example:

Jenkins pipeline succeeded but deployment failed.

🏅 Priority 4 – Docker (HIGH – 85%)

They expect strong Docker knowledge.

They will ask:

Dockerfile best practices

Image optimization

Container startup issues

ImagePullBackOff debugging

🏅 Priority 5 – Terraform (HIGH – 80%)

Infrastructure automation is key for this role.

They will ask:

State file

State locking

Modules

terraform apply lifecycle

Drift detection

Scenario example:

Terraform state locked — what will you do?

🏅 Priority 6 – Monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch) (MEDIUM–HIGH – 70%)

They explicitly mention monitoring.

They may ask:

What do you monitor?

How do you detect issues?

How do you configure alerts?

Scenario example:

CPU usage suddenly increases.

🏅 Priority 7 – Linux (MEDIUM – 60%)

They will ask some Linux troubleshooting.

Examples:

Disk full troubleshooting

Process issues

Permission issues

Commands:

top

df

free

ps

netstat

journalctl

🏅 Priority 8 – Networking Basics (MEDIUM – 55%)

Not deep networking, but basic.

Examples:

DNS resolution

Service communication

Security groups

🏅 Priority 9 – Helm (MEDIUM – 50%)

Since you are learning Helm now, they may ask basic questions.

Examples:

What is Helm chart

values.yaml

helm upgrade vs install

🏅 Priority 10 – Security (MEDIUM–LOW – 40%)

Basic security questions:

IAM roles

Kubernetes RBAC

Secret management
