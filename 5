Introduction

Can you give your introduction?

🔹 AWS – S3 & Cross Account Access

What AWS services have you used?

How will you restrict access to a specific object in an S3 bucket for a specific user?

If you have:

Application running on EC2 in Account A

S3 bucket in Account B

How will you allow the EC2 application to read data from the S3 bucket?

How will you give temporary access (10–15 minutes) to a specific S3 object?

If:

Bucket A is in Mumbai (ap-south-1)

Bucket B is in Oregon (us-west-2)

Application in Bucket A needs to fetch images from Bucket B

How will you establish communication between these two buckets (cross-region access)?

If Lambda in Account A needs to communicate with EC2 in Account B,

How will you establish cross-account communication?

🔹 Kubernetes

Explain Kubernetes architecture.

What types of services are available in Kubernetes?

If you want to run one pod on every node (like Filebeat or monitoring agent),

What will you use?

If you want to schedule specific pods only on specific nodes,

How will you do it?

What is the use of Namespace in Kubernetes?

If Pod A is in Namespace A and Pod B is in Namespace B,

How will you enable communication?

How will you stop communication between two pods?

What is the difference between Secret and ConfigMap?

If we can Base64 encode data and store it in ConfigMap,

Why should we use Secrets?

🔹 Docker

Can we delete an image from which a container is running?

If you delete the image and then stop the container,

Can you restart the container?

🔹 HTTP / Authentication

What do you understand by 401 and 403 error codes?

How will you troubleshoot 401 or 403 errors?

🔹 Jenkins

How will you trigger Jenkins pipeline automatically from Git?

What is a Multibranch Pipeline?

How will you configure different Jenkins slaves/agents for different environments?

🔹 AWS – Cost Optimization

If non-production RDS databases should stop during weekends and nights to save cost,

What setup will you implement?

🔹 Terraform

How do you manage Terraform state file?

How will you manage state files for multiple environments (Dev, Stage, Prod)?

How will you provision 5 identical EC2 instances using Terraform?

If VPC is created manually and you only know its name,

How will you fetch VPC ID in Terraform at runtime?

What is Dynamic Block in Terraform?

🔹 Linux

How will you increase disk space on Linux server (EC2)?

How will you troubleshoot slow Linux server performance?

How will you check which files are consuming high disk space in a directory?

🔹 Git

How do you manage versioning in Git?

Can you edit an existing tag?

How will you handle a hotfix release?

🔹 Monitoring

Have you worked with monitoring tools?

How did you set up Prometheus and Grafana?

How will you troubleshoot pod errors like:
