Introduction

Give your introduction.

🔹 AWS – EC2 & Networking

On which cloud have you worked mostly?

What AWS services have you used?

If you need to launch an EC2 instance daily, install Python, run commands, and stop it to save cost —
How will you automate this process?

How do you differentiate between a public EC2 and a private EC2?

Can you convert a public EC2 into a private EC2 without modifying the route table?

What is a key pair in EC2?

How does an EC2 instance get its IP address?

Can we assign a custom public or private IP address of our choice to an EC2 instance?

🔹 AWS – S3

If you have:

S3 bucket in Account A

S3 bucket in Account B
And you want replication between them —
How will you configure cross-account communication?

How will you automate deletion of S3 objects after 180 days?

Instead of deleting, how will you move S3 objects from one storage class to another automatically?

How will you configure event notification when:

A file is uploaded

A file is deleted from S3?

Have you worked with Lambda functions?

🔹 AWS – IAM

What is Trust Relationship in IAM?

What is Permission Boundary in IAM?

If:

Role has S3 Full Access

Permission Boundary allows only S3 Read Access
What actions can be performed?

🔹 AWS – RDS Cost Optimization

For Dev and Staging RDS databases:

They should not run at night or weekends

Production must run 24/7
How will you save cost for non-production databases?

🔹 AWS – Auto Scaling

What are the different policies available in Auto Scaling?

How will you configure scaling based on CPU utilization (50%, 70%, 80%)?

What is Scheduled Action in Auto Scaling?

If both:

Scheduled Action

Target Tracking Policy
exist and CPU remains high after scheduled scale-down time —
What will happen?

🔹 Kubernetes

When do we use:

DaemonSet

StatefulSet?

How will you ensure production pods are scheduled only on specific 4 nodes?

What is Pod Affinity and Pod Anti-Affinity?

How does RBAC work in Kubernetes?

What is a Kubernetes Service?

What are the types of Services in Kubernetes?

What happens when Service type is LoadBalancer?

If Target Group in Load Balancer is unhealthy —
How will you troubleshoot?

🔹 Terraform

What is Data Block in Terraform?

How will you connect to an EC2 instance and run commands using Terraform?

What are different provisioners in Terraform?

How will you ensure module dependency (VPC → EC2 → RDS)?

How do you pass output from one module to another?

🔹 Docker

What is the difference between CMD and ENTRYPOINT?

How do you override ENTRYPOINT?

What is Mutability and Immutability in Docker?

Between ADD and COPY, which is more secure?

Can you delete a Docker image if a container is running from it? What happens?

🔹 Jenkins

How do you manage sensitive information in Jenkins?

🔹 Linux

How will you troubleshoot a slow Linux server?

🔹 Kubernetes Secrets

Where will you store SSL certificate — Kubernetes Secret or AWS Secret Manager?

Why should we use Secret instead of ConfigMap if both can store encoded values?

🔹 Terraform vs CloudFormation

What is the advantage of Terraform over CloudFormation?

Can the same Terraform code provision infrastructure across AWS, Azure, and GCP?

🔹 Behavioral

What major challenges have you faced as a DevOps Engineer and what did you learn?
